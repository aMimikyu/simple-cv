## Projects

#### Java 101 Workshop [(github link)](https://github.com/ionian-uni-ieee/Java-101-Networking-Multithreading)

Organized and managed an introductory workshop to teach first-year students the basics of java within the context of the IEEE Student Branch. Across multiple sessions I walked them through the process of creating a basic chat application and the java fundamentals that are needed for it. Topics included OOP, IO, Exceptions, GUI, Networking and Multihtreading.

#### Breast Cancer Biomarker App [(github link)](https://github.com/aMimikyu/assess-breast-cancer-risk)

Created an Android mobile application using WEKA and data provided by the University of Coimbra to predict whether a person had breast cancer or not. Testing the application using patient data resulted in an accurate prediction about ~75% of the time. While the accuracy doesnâ€™t match the accuracy provided by top hospital applications, this project served me as a great introduction to machine learning and mobile development.
